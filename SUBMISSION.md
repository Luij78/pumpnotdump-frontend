# pump.notdump.fun — Pump.fun Hackathon Submission

## Project Name
**pump.notdump.fun** — AI-Powered Anti-Rug Protection for Pump.fun

## Live Demo
https://pumpnotdump-landing.vercel.app

## What It Does
An autonomous AI agent that monitors Pump.fun token launches in real-time, scoring each token's rug-pull risk using on-chain data analysis. Features:

- **Token Scanner** — Real-time monitoring of new Pump.fun launches
- **Risk Scoring** — Multi-factor rug analysis (liquidity, holder distribution, dev wallet behavior)
- **Community Voting** — Decentralized rug reporting and verification
- **Leaderboard** — Track top-performing tokens and worst offenders
- **Analytics Dashboard** — Volume trends, launch patterns, market health
- **Token Deep Dive** — Per-token risk breakdown with on-chain evidence

## How It Works
1. Monitors Pump.fun token launches via on-chain events
2. Analyzes holder distribution, liquidity depth, dev wallet patterns
3. Generates risk scores (0-100) using weighted multi-factor model
4. Community can vote on token legitimacy
5. Dashboard aggregates signals for informed trading decisions

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js 14, React, Tailwind CSS
- **Blockchain:** Solana (devnet), Anchor framework
- **AI Agent:** Autonomous monitoring with Claude + custom risk model
- **Data:** CoinGecko API, Solana RPC, DexScreener
- **Hosting:** Vercel

## Why This Matters
Pump.fun has become the #1 token launchpad but also a rug-pull factory. Traders need tools to separate legitimate projects from scams. pump.notdump.fun provides that protection layer using AI + on-chain analysis.
